# Requirements

Notes from Wednesday's call (3/22/2017) from Rob's vision of the application. 
The next step here is to convert these notes into technical requirements that we can use to begin mobile application development process.

## Purpose: 
The app will help disadvantaged teenage girls achieve success in their musical and college careers by providing them a platform to spotlight their work

## Tagline:

Basically 9 pages (views):

## Primary users:
1. Amateur songwriter / singers
2. Teen girls looking to connect with friends / music (looking for the same functionality as Instagram / Snapchat)

## Landing page list view:
(similar to Snapchat, can swipe up, swipe down)
- Should display videos from the teen girls that are currently trending (perhaps three, sorted by view count)
- Videos are not hosted internally, housed on YouTube?

## Actions:
- Swipe (one direction) → view for covers 
- Swipe (other direction) → view for original music/work
- Swipe (up) → details/background view for the song

## Shayla detail view:
- A definition of the name of Shayla (“from the fairy palace”), the purpose for the app, etc. and will host a video describing the overall mission of HRW.

## Song detail view:
- Plays the song / video, tracks the number of users and views

## Profile page detail view:
- Can view details about their biography (include text, picture, etc.)
- View “fan base” (plugs)
- Some interactivity functions with followers / fans

## “Other users” list view:
- Can view songs uploaded by the general public

## Other functionality:
- Ability to share on social media (facebook, twitter, etc.)
- Ability to record video straight from the application
- Replicate “streak” functionality from Snapchat
- Ability to spotlight the highest performing artists
- Functionality to determine who is eligible to be considered as a user in the app
- Ability to do some micro-funding on the application (will need to incorporate payment processing)
